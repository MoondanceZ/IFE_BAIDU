			<h2>About C#.</h2>
			<p>
				In one sense, C# is the same thing to programming languages that .NET is to the Windows environment. Just as Microsoft has
				been adding more and more features to Windows and the Windows API over the past 15 years, Visual Basic 2012 and C++ have
				undergone expansion. Although Visual Basic and C++ have resulted in hugely powerful languages, both languages also suffer
				from problems because of the legacies left over from the way they evolved.
